# 🛠️ SDK Overview

The Mothrbox SDKs allow developers to integrate military-grade encrypted decentralized storage directly into their applications.

All SDKs provide the same core features as the CLI and Cloud dashboard:
- End-to-end encryption in the client
- Support for AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and ECC P-256
- Direct upload/retrieval from the Walrus decentralized network
- Simple Blob ID management

## Available SDKs

| Language   | Status          | Package / Repo                                      | Best For                          |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | In Development | Coming soon                                         | Web apps, Next.js, React, Node.js |
| Rust       | Planned         | Coming soon                                         | High-performance native apps      |

## Core Features (All SDKs)

- **Client-side encryption** – Data never leaves your app unencrypted
- **Zero-knowledge** – Mothrbox servers cannot access your data
- **Simple API** – Encrypt/upload in just a few lines
- **Blob ID return** – Easy sharing and retrieval
- **Multiple encryption modes** – Choose per-file or per-app

## Example Use Cases
- Web3 dApps storing user files off-chain
- Mobile apps with encrypted backups
- Desktop apps with secure cloud sync
- Backend services archiving encrypted data

## Getting Started
SDKs are currently in active development. The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK will launch first.
