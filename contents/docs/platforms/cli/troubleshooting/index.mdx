# 🔧 Troubleshooting

Common problems and their solutions when using the Mothrbox CLI.

## System Not Starting or Status Shows Stopped

```bash
./mothrbox status
# If not running:
./mothrbox start
./mothrbox logs  # Check for errors in output
```

Common causes:
- Docker not running — start Docker daemon
- Port conflict — stop other services on the same port
- Permission issues — run with sudo if needed (not recommended long-term)

## Upload Failed / "Upload to Walrus failed"

- Check your `.env` file has correct `SUI_SECRET_KEY`
- Verify wallet has SUI tokens:
  ```bash
  sui client balance
  ```
- Get testnet tokens: https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/
- Restart system:
  ```bash
  ./mothrbox restart
  ```

## Decryption Failed / "Decryption failed: invalid MAC"

Most common causes:
1. Wrong password (case-sensitive!)
2. Wrong encryption mode (used AES but trying ChaCha decrypt, or vice versa)
3. Wrong Blob ID (copy-paste error)

Double-check:
- Exact Blob ID
- Exact password
- Matching encrypt/decrypt command

Test with known good file if possible.

## "Container not found" or Docker Errors

```bash
docker ps -a | grep mothrbox
./mothrbox rebuild  # Rebuild containers
./mothrbox clean    # Full reset (deletes data — use carefully)
```

## Key Issues (ECC Mode)

- "Invalid public key" → Key file corrupted or wrong format
- "Private key required" → Make sure private.key is in data/ folder
- Lost private key → **Irrecoverable** — data cannot be decrypted

## Network / Connection Issues

- Ensure internet connection
- Walrus network may have temporary outages — check status if available
- Try again in a few minutes

## Still Stuck?

- Check GitHub repo for issues: https://github.com/georgegoldman/mothrbox_v2/issues
- Run with verbose logs:
  ```bash
  ./mothrbox logs
  ```
