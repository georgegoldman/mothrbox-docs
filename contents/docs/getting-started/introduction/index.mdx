description: Overview of Mothrbox – a privacy-first data storage layer built with RESTful APIs.
---

**Mothrbox** is a **privacy-first, developer-focused** data storage layer built for modern decentralized and hybrid applications. It enables you to securely encrypt, store, and retrieve anything — models, documents, blobs, metadata — using **RESTful APIs**.

Mothrbox takes care of all the heavy lifting: from secure encryption (ECC) to ultra-fast decryption and edge-based storage. Whether you're building a Web3 app, an AI backend, or handling confidential documents, Mothrbox simplifies secure storage.

## Getting Started

To begin using Mothrbox:

- [ ] Create a Mothrbox account
- [ ] Generate an API key
- [ ] Start uploading encrypted or plain files using the REST API

> ⚠️ **Note**: SDKs for languages like Rust, JavaScript, and Python are coming soon. For now, integration is fully supported through REST endpoints.

## Storage Modes

Mothrbox supports two flexible modes:

- **🔐 Encrypted Mode**  
  Your data is encrypted client-side with modern ECC (NIST P-256) and stored securely. Only those with the correct private key can decrypt it.

- **📂 Plain Mode**  
  Data is stored unencrypted for public or open-access scenarios. Ideal for media, metadata, or fast delivery.

## Blockquotes

> “With Mothrbox, you don’t need to choose between speed and security — you get both.”

The API is designed to be fast, intuitive, and secure — so you can ship faster and protect user data effortlessly.

## Example REST Request

```http
POST /v1/storage/encrypted
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": "base64-encoded-payload",
  "filename": "report.pdf"
}

```

> This endpoint stores encrypted content. You can later retrieve and decrypt it using the corresponding private key.

## Use Cases
- 🔐 Role-based or token-gated content systems

- 💾 Off-chain embeddings, AI model storage

- 🧾 Secure invoices, receipts, or billing records

- 🧬 Medical or identity document vaults

- 🚀 Web2+3 hybrid apps needing secure persistence

## Conclusion
**Mothrbox** brings high-performance, secure storage to your stack via a simple REST API. Whether you’re handling public media or deeply confidential documents, Mothrbox provides encryption, storage, and retrieval — all in one place.

Built with privacy in mind. Powered by performance. Ready for developers.
