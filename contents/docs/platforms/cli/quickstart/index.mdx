# ⚡ CLI Quickstart

Get Mothrbox running locally and encrypt your first file in under 5 minutes using the command-line interface.

## Prerequisites
- Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2 recommended)
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- A Sui wallet with testnet/mainnet tokens

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/georgegoldman/mothrbox_v2
cd mothrbox_v2
```

### 2. Make CLI Executable
```bash
chmod +x mothrbox
```

### 3. Configure Your Sui Wallet
```bash
cd mothrbox_ts
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit and add your SUI_SECRET_KEY
cd ..
```

### 4. Build and Start Mothrbox
```bash
./mothrbox build
./mothrbox start
```

Expected output:
```
✅ MothrBox server is running!
```

### 5. Encrypt Your First File (AES-256-GCM)
```bash
echo "My secret data" > secret.txt
./mothrbox encrypt secret.txt "StrongPassword2025!"
```

You’ll see:
```
✅ Encrypted and uploaded successfully!
📦 Encrypted Blob ID: abc123xyz...
```

> 🔑 **Save this Blob ID and password securely!**

### 6. Download and Decrypt
```bash
./mothrbox decrypt abc123xyz... recovered.txt "StrongPassword2025!"
cat data/recovered.txt
# Output: My secret data
```

🎉 Done! You’ve successfully used the Mothrbox CLI.
