## Installation

There’s nothing to install — Mothrbox is a cloud-native service with a RESTful API. Just set up your account and you’re ready to store encrypted or plain data.

### Step 1: Create a Mothrbox Account

Go to [mothrbox](https://mothrbox-frontend.vercel.app/) and sign up. This gives you access to the dashboard and key management.

### Step 2: Generate an API Key

In your dashboard, generate a new API key. This will be used to authenticate every request to Mothrbox.

> ⚠️ Keep your API key secret — treat it like a password.

### Step 3: Start Making API Calls

Use `curl`, Postman, or your backend service to start storing or retrieving files via the Mothrbox API.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mothrbox.io/v1/storage/encrypted \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"model.bin", "data":"base64-encoded-data"}'
```
