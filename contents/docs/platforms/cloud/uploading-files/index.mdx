# 📤 Uploading Files

Uploading is simple: drag-and-drop or click to select files. Encryption happens automatically in your browser.

### Step-by-Step Upload

1. Log in to the dashboard.
2. Click the **Upload** button (or drag files directly onto the page).

3. Select your file(s) or folder (multiple uploads supported).
4. Choose your **encryption mode** (default: AES-256-GCM):
    - **AES-256-GCM** – Best for general use (fast on desktop)
    - **XOR** – Optimized for mobile/ARM
    - **ECC** – Public key encryption
