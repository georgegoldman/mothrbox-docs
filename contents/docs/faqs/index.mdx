# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is MothrBox?

MothrBox is a self-hosted encrypted decentralized storage system that combines military-grade encryption (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, ECC P-256) with Walrus Protocol's decentralized storage infrastructure. It encrypts your data locally before uploading to a distributed network.

### Is MothrBox free?

**Self-hosted version:** Yes, the CLI tool is completely free and open-source. You only pay for Sui network transaction fees (typically a few cents per upload).

**Managed API:** Coming soon with free and paid tiers.

### Do I need to run a server?

No server needed! MothrBox runs locally on your machine using Docker. Your data is encrypted locally and stored on Walrus Protocol's decentralized network.

## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum:**
- Docker 20.10+
- 2GB RAM
- 5GB disk space
- Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2)
- Sui wallet with testnet/mainnet tokens

**Recommended:**
- 4GB+ RAM
- 10GB+ disk space
- Fast internet connection

### How do I get started?

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/georgegoldman/mothrbox_v2
cd mothrbox_v2

# Configure Sui wallet
cd mothrbox_ts
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your SUI_SECRET_KEY

# Build and start
cd ..
./mothrbox rebuild
./mothrbox start
```

See the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation) for details.

### Where do I get SUI tokens?

**Testnet (Free):**
- Visit [https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/](https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/)
- Enter your wallet address
- Get free testnet SUI for testing

**Mainnet:**
- Purchase from exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
- Typical cost: $0.01-0.05 per upload

## Encryption & Security

### Which encryption algorithm should I use?

**AES-256-GCM (Default):**
- Best for desktop/server with Intel/AMD processors
- Hardware-accelerated, fastest for most users
- NIST/FIPS compliant

**ChaCha20-Poly1305:**
- Best for mobile devices and ARM processors
- Faster on devices without AES hardware acceleration
- Great for IoT and Raspberry Pi

**ECC (P-256):**
- Best for sharing without password exchange
- Use public key cryptography
- Perfect for multi-recipient scenarios

See [Storage Modes](/docs/storage-modes) for detailed comparison.

### What happens if I lose my password?

**Password-based (AES, ChaCha20):** Your data is **permanently unrecoverable**. MothrBox cannot reset or recover passwords. Always:
- Use a password manager
- Store passwords securely
- Test decryption before deleting originals

**Key-based (ECC):** If you lose your private key, the data is **permanently unrecoverable**. Always:
- Back up private keys securely
- Store encrypted copies in multiple locations
- Never share private keys

### What happens if I lose the private key (ECC)?

Encrypted files will be **permanently unreadable**. MothrBox cannot recover your key. This is by design - true end-to-end encryption means only you control access.

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Back up private key securely
cp data/private.key /secure/backup/location/
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 private.key
# Store encrypted backup in multiple locations
```

### Is my data really private?

**Yes, absolutely.** Your data is encrypted **before it leaves your machine**. MothrBox never sees your unencrypted data, passwords, or private keys. The encryption happens locally in the Rust engine running in your Docker container.

**No one can access your data without:**
- Password-based: Your password
- Key-based: Your private key

Not even the Walrus Protocol operators can decrypt your files.

### Can Walrus Protocol see my files?

No. Walrus Protocol only stores **encrypted blobs**. They cannot:
- See the original filename
- Read the content
- Decrypt the data
- Know what's inside

Only you (with the password or private key) can decrypt.

### Are passwords stored anywhere?

**No.** Passwords and private keys are **never stored** by MothrBox. They exist only:
1. In your memory
2. In your command when you type it
3. Temporarily in RAM during encryption/decryption

Once the operation completes, they're gone.

---

## Data Storage

### Where is my data stored?

Your encrypted data is stored on **Walrus Protocol**, a decentralized storage network built on Sui blockchain. Data is:
- Distributed across multiple storage nodes
- Protected by erasure coding (survives node failures)
- Backed by blockchain storage proofs

### How long is data stored?

**Default:** 3 epochs (~30 days for testnet)

You can configure longer storage:
```bash
# In mothrbox_ts/.env
WALRUS_EPOCHS=10  # ~100 days
```

For permanent storage, you'll need to periodically renew storage epochs.

### What's the max file size?

**Current limits:**
- No hard limit in MothrBox CLI
- Limited by available RAM and Walrus Protocol constraints
- Practical limit: ~1GB per file recommended
- Larger files: Split into chunks or compress first

**Tips for large files:**
```bash
# Compress before encrypting
tar czf archive.tar.gz large_directory/
./mothrbox encrypt archive.tar.gz "Password123"

# Split large files
split -b 500M huge_file.iso part_
./mothrbox encrypt part_aa "Password123"
./mothrbox encrypt part_ab "Password123"
```

### Can I delete uploaded data?

**Yes, but:**
- You need the blob ID
- Deletion depends on Walrus Protocol support
- After storage epoch expires, data is automatically removed
- Currently, explicit deletion requires direct Walrus API calls

### What happens if storage nodes go offline?

**Erasure coding protects your data.** Walrus Protocol uses erasure coding, meaning:
- Data is split across multiple nodes
- Can survive multiple node failures
- Automatically reconstructs data from available nodes
- Default redundancy survives loss of 2/3 of nodes

---

## Usage & Operations

### Can I use MothrBox without Docker?

Not easily. The current architecture requires:
- Docker container for Rust encryption engine
- Deno runtime for Walrus client
- Specific dependency versions

You could manually set up the environment, but Docker is **strongly recommended** for reliability.

### Can I run MothrBox on a server?

Yes! MothrBox works great on servers:
```bash
# Remote server via SSH
ssh user@server
cd mothrbox_v2
./mothrbox start

# Run in background
nohup ./mothrbox start &

# Or use systemd service (advanced)
```

### How do I backup multiple files?

**Option 1: Individual encryption**
```bash
for file in *.pdf; do
  ./mothrbox encrypt "$file" "Password123"
done
```

**Option 2: Archive first**
```bash
tar czf backup.tar.gz ~/important_files/
./mothrbox encrypt backup.tar.gz "BackupPass123"
```

**Option 3: Automated script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
tar czf "backup_${DATE}.tar.gz" ~/Documents/
./mothrbox encrypt "backup_${DATE}.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_PASSWORD"
rm "backup_${DATE}.tar.gz"
```

### Can I share encrypted files with others?

**Yes, three ways:**

**Method 1: Share password (AES/ChaCha20)**
```bash
./mothrbox encrypt file.pdf "SharedPassword123"
# Share blob ID via email
# Share password via phone/Signal
```

**Method 2: Use ECC (no password exchange)**
```bash
./mothrbox keygen  # Recipient generates keys
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt file.pdf recipient_public.key
# Share blob ID publicly - only they can decrypt
```

**Method 3: Multi-recipient (ECC)**
```bash
# Encrypt once for each recipient
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt file.pdf alice_public.key
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt file.pdf bob_public.key
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt file.pdf carol_public.key
```

### Can I automate backups?

**Yes, with cron:**
```bash
# Create backup script
cat > ~/backup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/mothrbox_v2
./mothrbox start
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
tar czf "/tmp/backup_${DATE}.tar.gz" ~/important_files/
./mothrbox encrypt "/tmp/backup_${DATE}.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_PASSWORD"
rm "/tmp/backup_${DATE}.tar.gz"
EOF

chmod +x ~/backup.sh

# Schedule daily at 2 AM
crontab -e
# Add: 0 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
```

## Blob IDs & Retrieval

### What is a blob ID?

A blob ID is a **unique identifier** for your encrypted data stored on Walrus Protocol. It looks like:
```
DcNxScTcvltoCYZwLPVC45QNFpddxjL8FmueI7I7-Ho
```

**Important:**
- Blob ID alone cannot decrypt your data
- Safe to share publicly
- Needed to retrieve your files
- Store in password manager or secure notes

### Are blob IDs safe to share?

**Yes!** Blob IDs are public identifiers. They're useless without:
- Password (for AES/ChaCha20)
- Private key (for ECC)

**Safe to share via:**
- Email, Slack, Discord
- Public GitHub issues
- Social media
- Documentation

**Never share together:**
- Blob ID + password in same message
- Blob ID + private key in same location

### I lost my blob ID. Can I recover it?

**No built-in recovery**, but you might find it in:

```bash
# Command history
history | grep "Blob ID"

# Your blob registry (if you created one)
cat blob_registry.csv

# Terminal scrollback
# Scroll up in your terminal

# Log files (if you redirected output)
cat mothrbox_output.log
```

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Always save blob IDs
echo "$(date),filename.pdf,<blob-id>" >> blob_registry.csv
```

## Performance & Costs

### How fast is encryption/decryption?

**Approximate speeds:**

| Algorithm | 100MB File |
|-----------|-----------|
| AES-256-GCM* | ~200ms |
| ChaCha20 | ~250ms |
| ECC | ~2s |

*With AES-NI hardware acceleration

### How much does it cost?

**Self-hosted CLI:**
- Software: **Free** (open-source)
- Sui transaction fees: ~$0.01-0.05 per upload
- Storage: Included in transaction fee (default 3 epochs)
- No monthly subscription

**Testnet:** Completely free (using testnet SUI tokens)

### How much SUI do I need?

**Testnet:** Free unlimited tokens from faucet

**Mainnet:** ~$1-5 of SUI tokens for casual use (100-500 files)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Container won't start

```bash
# Check Docker
docker --version

# Check if port 8000 is available
sudo lsof -i :8000

# View logs
./mothrbox logs

# Clean rebuild
./mothrbox clean
./mothrbox rebuild
./mothrbox start
```

### Encryption fails

```bash
# Check container status
./mothrbox status

# Check file exists
ls -lh file.pdf

# Check permissions
chmod 644 file.pdf

# Try with absolute path
./mothrbox encrypt /full/path/to/file.pdf "Password"
```

### Upload fails

```bash
# Check .env configuration
cat mothrbox_ts/.env

# Verify SUI_SECRET_KEY is set
# Check SUI balance
sui client balance

# Get testnet tokens
# Visit: https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/
```

### Decryption fails

**Common causes:**
1. Wrong password (case-sensitive!)
2. Wrong blob ID (typo?)
3. Wrong encryption algorithm
4. Storage epoch expired

```bash
# Try manual download first
docker exec mothrbox_system bash -c "
  deno run -A --env-file=mothrbox_ts/.env \
  mothrbox_ts/src/walrus-cli.ts download <blob-id> /app/data/test.enc
"

# Check if file was downloaded
ls -lh data/test.enc
```
