# 📖 Commands Reference

All commands are run using `./mothrbox <command> [arguments]`

## System Management

```bash
./mothrbox start        # Start the Mothrbox system (Docker containers)
./mothrbox stop         # Stop the running system
./mothrbox restart      # Restart the system
./mothrbox status       # Show current system status
./mothrbox logs         # View real-time logs from containers
./mothrbox rebuild      # Rebuild the system (useful after code changes)
./mothrbox clean        # Remove all containers and data (use with caution!)
./mothrbox test         # Run system tests
./mothrbox help         # Display this help menu
```

## Encryption & Upload Commands

### AES-256-GCM (Default - Best for general use & hardware acceleration)
```bash
./mothrbox encrypt <input-file> <password>
# Example:
./mothrbox encrypt confidential.pdf "MyStrongPassword2026!"
```

### ChaCha20-Poly1305 (Mobile & ARM optimized)
```bash
./mothrbox chacha-encrypt <input-file> <password>
# Example:
./mothrbox chacha-encrypt vacation-video.mp4 "MobilePass2026!"
```

### ECC P-256 (Public-key cryptography - no password sharing needed)
```bash
./mothrbox keygen                              # Generate your key pair (private.key + public.key)
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt <input-file> <recipient-public.key>
# Example:
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt report.pdf bob_public.key
```

## Decryption & Download Commands

```bash
./mothrbox decrypt <blob-id> <output-file> <password>
# AES or ChaCha20 example:
./mothrbox decrypt abc123xyz... recovered.pdf "MyStrongPassword2026!"

./mothrbox chacha-decrypt <blob-id> <output-file> <password>
# ChaCha20 specific

./mothrbox ecc-decrypt <blob-id> <output-file> <private.key>
# ECC example:
./mothrbox ecc-decrypt abc123xyz... report.pdf private.key
```

## Quick Examples

### Batch Encryption
```bash
for file in *.docx; do
  ./mothrbox encrypt "$file" "BatchPass2026!"
done
```

### Secure Sharing (ECC - Password-free)
```bash
# Recipient shares their public.key with you
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt sensitive-data.zip recipient_public.key
# Send only the Blob ID - recipient uses their private key to decrypt
```

## Tips
- Always save the **Blob ID** returned after upload
- Store passwords/keys separately from Blob IDs
- Test decryption immediately after upload
