# 🚀 Advanced Usage

Understand the three encryption modes and choose the right one for your needs.

## Encryption Algorithms Overview

Mothrbox supports three battle-tested encryption algorithms, each optimized for different scenarios:

| Feature                  | AES-256-GCM                          | ChaCha20-Poly1305                    | ECC (P-256)                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Speed (Desktop/x86)**  | Very Fast (hardware accelerated)     | Fast                                 | Moderate                             |
| **Speed (Mobile/ARM)**   | Good                                 | Excellent (software optimized)       | Good                                 |
| **Hardware Acceleration**| ✅ AES-NI (Intel/AMD)                 | ❌ None                               | ❌ None                               |
| **Authentication**       | Password-based                       | Password-based                       | Public/Private Key (no password)     |
| **Multi-Recipient**      | Requires re-encryption per recipient | Requires re-encryption per recipient | ✅ Native (encrypt once for many)     |
| **Overhead**             | +28 bytes                            | +44 bytes                            | +65 bytes                            |
| **Best For**             | General purpose, large files, compliance | Mobile, IoT, ARM devices            | Secure sharing without password exchange |

## When to Use Each Mode

### AES-256-GCM (Default)
- Ideal for desktops/servers with Intel or AMD CPUs
- Industry standard used by Signal, WhatsApp, 1Password
- NIST-approved and FIPS-compliant
- Perfect for enterprise backups, legal documents, healthcare data

```bash
./mothrbox encrypt large-backup.tar.gz "EnterprisePass2026!"
```

### ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Faster on devices without hardware acceleration (phones, Raspberry Pi, IoT)
- Used in WireGuard VPN and modern TLS
- Constant-time implementation resists timing attacks

```bash
./mothrbox chacha-encrypt mobile-photos.zip "MobileBackup2026!"
```

### ECC P-256 (Public-Key Encryption)
- No password sharing required — perfect for collaboration
- Encrypt once for multiple recipients using their public keys
- Based on NIST P-256 curve (NSA Suite B approved)

```bash
# Generate keys (once per user)
./mothrbox keygen

# Share your public.key freely
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt team-report.pdf alice_public.key
./mothrbox ecc-encrypt team-report.pdf bob_public.key
# Same Blob ID works for both — only they can decrypt!
```

## Security Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passwords (20+ characters)
- Store Blob IDs and passwords/keys in separate locations
- Test decryption before deleting original files
- Shred local files after successful upload:
  ```bash
  shred -vfz -n 10 sensitive-file.pdf
  ```
