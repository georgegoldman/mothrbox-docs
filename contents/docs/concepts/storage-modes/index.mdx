# 📂 Storage Modes
Mothrbox offers two modes of file storage:
## 🔐 Encrypted Mode
- Data is encrypted client-side using ECC

- Only retrievable by users with the private key

## 📁 Plain Mode
- Data is stored without encryption
- Ideal for open content, public media, or non-sensitive metadata

> Use encrypted mode when confidentiality matters.
