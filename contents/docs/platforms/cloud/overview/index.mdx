# 🌥️ Cloud Dashboard Overview

The **Mothrbox Cloud Dashboard** provides a simple, intuitive web interface for uploading, managing, and sharing your encrypted files – without needing the CLI.

All encryption still happens **client-side in your browser** (military-grade, same as CLI), ensuring your data remains private before it's stored on the decentralized Walrus network.

### Key Features

- 🔒 End-to-end encryption (AES-256-GCM by default, with options for others)
- 📤 Drag-and-drop uploads
- 📂 File browsing and organization
- 🔗 Secure sharing via links
- 📊 Usage stats and account management
- 🌐 Accessible from any device with a browser

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Go to [mothrbox](https://www.mothrbox.xyz/dashboard).
2. Connect your wallet (Slush wallet recommended).

> ⚠️ **Important**: Your private keys never leave your device. Use a secure wallet and enable 2FA if available.

Once Authenticated, you'll see your main file dashboard:

From here you can upload files, view your storage usage, and manage everything visually.
