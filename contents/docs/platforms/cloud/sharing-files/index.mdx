# 🔗 Sharing Files

Share encrypted files safely – recipients need the password/key to decrypt.

### Generating a Share Link

1. Click the share icon next to a file.

    ![Share icon](/img/cloud/share-icon.png)

2. Copy the **public share link** (contains Blob ID).
3. Optionally set expiration or view limits (if available in your plan).

4. Send the link via any channel + password separately.

### Best Practices

- ✅ Share link publicly (safe without password).
- ✅ Send password via different channel (phone, Signal).
- ❌ Never send link + password together.

For password-free sharing: Use ECC mode (coming soon) with recipient public keys.
